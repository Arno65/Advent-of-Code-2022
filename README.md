# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains most of my solutions for Advent of Code 2022.
My main programming language is Haskell. I'll also do some work in Swift, Common Lisp and Python.

For collecting the stars I will first code the solution in the language that works best for me. 
Most of the time that will be Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2022 account.

Day 1 has solutions in Haskell, Common Lisp and Python.\
I also did the Infi quest on day 1 in Haskell.

Day 2 has solutions in Haskell, Common Lisp and Python.

Day 3, 4 and 5 have solutions in Haskell.

Day 6 has solutions in Haskell and Python.

Day 7, 8, 9 and 10 have solutions in Haskell.\
(It took me more than a day to solve the day 7 quest. I misread the instructions for part 2.)
