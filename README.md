# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains most of my solutions for Advent of Code 2022.
My main programming language is Haskell. I'll also do some work in Swift, Common Lisp and Python.

For collecting the stars I will first code the solution in the language that works best for me. 
Most of the time that will be Haskell.

Spoiler alert: All code has the final results of the tasks in the comment section at the beginning of the code.
Also note that these final results are obtained with the puzzle input from my Advent-of-Code-2022 account.

Day 1 has solutions in Haskell, Common Lisp and Python.\
I also did the Infi quest on day 1 in Haskell.

Day 2 has solutions in Haskell, Common Lisp and Python.

Day 3, 4 and 5 have solutions in Haskell.

Day 6 has solutions in Haskell and Python.

Day 7 has two versions with solutions in Haskell\
It took me more than a day to solve the task for day 7.\
First I wanted to solve the task with builing a file system tree. That did not go well.
Next I created a list with all files incl. full path names. With that I solved part 1.
Then I misread the instructions for part 2. Here I wasted many hours.
In the weekend I took time to rewrite the code day 7 and managed to 
create, fill and process the file system tree I wanted from the start.
Both version work 0K.\
The alternative version can be found in directory

Day 8, 9 and 10 have solutions in Haskell.

Day 12 has solutions in Haskell.\
Part 1 is working 0K but my code only works for a 'max one step down' situation. 
My AoC puzzle input only had one step down situations and produced the correct number of steps.\
Part 2 is just running part 1 (brute force) for all (41) start positions from the first column.

Day 13 has solutions in Haskell.\
(Both versions work 0K but I'm not happy with my 'packet compare' function.)

Day 14 has solutions in Haskell.

Day 15 has only the solution for part 1 in Haskell.\
(This code is slow. A faster version for both parts will probably be posted during the holidays.)

Day 17, 21, 23 and 24 have solutions in Haskell.
